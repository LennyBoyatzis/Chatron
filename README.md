![alt tag](./public/images/chatron.gif)

##Install

First, clone this repo (electron app)

`git clone https://github.com/LennyBoyatzis/Chatron.git`

Second, clone this other repo (backend)

`https://github.com/LennyBoyatzis/Chatron-Backend.git`

cd into both directories and run:

`npm install`

##Run

To run the electron app we are going to run the following two commands in separate console tabs

```
npm run watch
npm start
```

Now we need to open a third console tab and run the backend with the command:

`node index.js`
